# Monster Hunter Stories 2 - Quick Reference

Hello. I created this page as a quick reference guide on some post-game monsters based on my own game experiences.

Details include the monster attack patterns, skills used, parts to break, element weakness and egg pattern.

WIP, but it will not be the full list.
